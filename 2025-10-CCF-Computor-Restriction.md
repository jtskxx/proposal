# Restrict CCF Proposal Creation to Computors Only

### Available Options:
> **Option 0**: No, I don’t want  

> **Option 1**: Yes, I approve 

## Summary

This proposal implements a restriction limiting CCF (Computor Controlled Fund) proposal creation exclusively to computors, addressing the ongoing issues of spam and low-quality proposals in 2025.

## Community Support

In August 2025, a community poll was made on Discord:  
**"Should we allow CCF proposals ONLY from Computors?"**

**Results:**
- ✅ **YES**: 85 votes (72%)
- ❌ **NO**: 33 votes (28%)
- **Total**: 118 votes

## Current Problem

- **Current system**: Anyone can create a CCF proposal by paying a fee of 1 million QU
- **Issue**: During the year of 2025, we saw many low-quality proposals asking for funding by the CCF with the objective of only getting funds without any useful contribution to the ecosystem, and also many spam proposals

## Rationale

Every CCF proposal needs to have a positive and real impact on the ecosystem.

The CCF wallet is funded by donations of 8% by all 676 computors every epoch. Those funds need to be spent wisely.

By restricting proposal creation to computors:
- Higher accountability and proposal quality
- Elimination of spam and frivolous funding requests

## Message to Builders

For any determined builder, we, the community, the computors and core developers are always looking forward to build new things on Qubic and we are always here to listen to your ideas and fund your project if there's a real positive impact on Qubic. Feel free to contact any moderators or core developers, we are always here to help.

## Conclusion

This proposal balances ecosystem protection with openness to innovation. By requiring computor involvement while maintaining pathways for all builders, we ensure CCF resources fund only projects that truly benefit Qubic.
